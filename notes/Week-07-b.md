### Introduction Activity

Returning to our introduction activity, you can choose a new game or reuse your previously chosen game.

We will divide up the strategy you gave for your chosen game in three different ways:
* Are there different units in your chosen game?
  * Can you divide up a master strategy so that each kind of unit gets a different sub-strategy to help the overall team win?
* Is there a unit which must move within the game universe to a given location, and then take action there?
  * can you re-state your previous strategy in terms of a sub-strategy for a "pilot" and a sub-strategy for a "gunner"

### New Strategy

[Our current strategy]() is successful on some maps at defeating the reference player.

Let's come up with a new strategy that uses radio communication and marking to augment our original strategy.

That is, we will have a new master strategy.
