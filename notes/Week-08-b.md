#### Test Class

Let's write a test class `SimpleStartupTestDrive.java` with a main method that instantiates `SimpleStartup` and calls some methods on it in a particular order.

#### Write Code

We will now write the `SimpleStartup.java` file in `activities/week-08`

What is the longest / most complicated method?

Taking turns driving (`git pull` first at the start), navigators read out the pseudocode above.

Try compiling and running it first, then commit and push.

## Break

#### Test Code?

#### Real Code

#### Happy Thanksgiving

You'll read Chapters 5 and 6, and finish implementing the `SinkAStartup.java` game as part of Homework 08.
