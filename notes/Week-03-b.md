# Week 03b

## First Half

### Git Status Review

* What are the four different statuses for each file in a Git repository?
* Through Zoom Remote Control, pick a file and make changes to Paul's VSCode / terminal so that it has each of the four statuses.

### Code Sharing In-Class Activity (Git)

* We each have code that is not "in" Git. What does that mean?
  * each of you, zip up your code (your entire repository directory) and email the attachment (or send by Discord DM)
  * unzip, and try to identify changes that you don't have, and integrate it into your codebase

To create the zip file, in your VS Code terminal, navigate to your `dgp-25au` directory and type the following
```
zip -r <your_username>.zip java
ls -lh
```

* Question:

  * what are some problems or shortcomings you notice with this approach of sharing code?
  * Come up with at least three, and [submit them in Canvas]().
  * Use the actual code you sent and received in ZIP files as examples.

### Discuss Battlecode
