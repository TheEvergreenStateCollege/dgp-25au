## First Half

* Review, a winning strategy is in sight
  * `teacher05b` vs. `refplayer`

* Dividing up strategy
  * between multiple kinds of units
  * between "pilot" and "gunner" of the same kind of unit

* Update to syllabus: you must beat refplayer on three maps chosen at random

## New Ideas

* Mopper strategy
  * moppers moving towards enemy paint
  * pilot vs. gunner way of dividing up a strategy
 
* Splasher strategy
  * spawning a new splasher
  * detecting painted squares and moving in a random direction until we find fresh squares

## Break

## Second Half

We come up with mob programming goals and create a GitHub issue for it based on our previous discussion.

* A main goal, which is meant to be hard enough to take 25 minutes, exercise some new skills, or explore a less familiar direction.
* A stretch goal, which is meant to be simpler and explore a more familiar development direction.

Mob programming in breakout room for 25 minutes.

Return 5 minutes before the end of class to regroup and discuss what happened.
