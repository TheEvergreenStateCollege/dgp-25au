### Java Development Environment

Keep working on our software setup and Java development environments.

Install the Liveshare plugin.

### Type Phrase-o-Matic

This will be our first pair programming practice, we will use the Liveshare plugin.

Choose one person to be the first driver and one to be the first navigator.

The first driver will share their VSCode window, share on Liveshare, copy their share URL, and
paste it into the Zoom chat.

The first navigator will join this URL with the same plugin.

Both will open the file `dgp-25au/activities/PhraseOMatic.java`

From Head First Java book, page 46, take turns reading aloud and typing in the phrase-o-matic program.


## Break

## Second Half 

### Pair Programming (In-Class Activity)

Work on the three tasks of `moveAndExplore` using pair programming.

Take turns being driver and navigator, switching in between each of the tasks below.

[Battlecode API Docs](https://releases.battlecode.org/javadoc/battlecode25/3.1.0/battlecode/common/package-summary.html)

#### Task 0
Come up with an expression using `directions` and `currentDirection`

#### Task 1
Use the `rc.canMove()` method to see if we can move this robot in the current direction.

#### Task 2
If we can move in a given direction, go ahead and move in that direction with `rc.move()`

### Discuss HW 02 and Quiz 02

Go over

* HW 02, due next Monday at 5pm
  * You'll need to set up a time to meet together (perhaps on Discord) to practice pair programming.
* Quiz 02, due tomorrow (Thursday) at 5pm
