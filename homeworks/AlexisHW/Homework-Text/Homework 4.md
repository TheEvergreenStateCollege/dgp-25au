Status, Add, Commit


### Part B: Game Design Reading


### Part C: Battlecode

Did this with Devon and Wren.


### Part D: Reflect

1. Slight frustration when running into problems since our levels of experience are so varied.
2. This may sound dark, but I approach Battlecode extremely mechanically and distantly.
3. It's basically the same premise as _Tooth and Tail_ but a lot more basic since this is a mob-programmed event. I think the story is interesting, I just don't think the visuals match it that well.
