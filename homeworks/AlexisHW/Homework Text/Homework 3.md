<ins>**PART A**</ins>


**1. What are three problems with sending ZIP files of your code between your teammates to work on the same code?**

Unsurity as to what version is the ‘correct’ version, or most updated version; extreme difficulty, if not impossibility, to merge and rectify code blocks; extremely cumbersome and time-consuming.


**2. What is the difference between git and GitHub?**

Git is the system that tracks the changes to a code itself, GitHub is a central repository that is online where Git repositories are stored.


**3. What is the difference between a local repository (your working directory) and a remote repository?**

Local repository is only controlled by you, remote repository is shared between you and everyone else with access to it.


**4. What is a read-only command you can run any number of times to know the status of your local repository?**

`git status`


<ins>**PART B**</ins>


Part B code assignments have been added, committed, and pushed on GitHub.

I am completely unable to run the Battlecode client on my computer. I would very much like help resolving this matter.


**Feedback from Prof. Pham, 12/01/25:**


**Part A**


Good answers. Local repository is also located on your laptop/own computer, and remote repository is usually on a server on the internet.


**Part B**

Good effort. MovieTestDrive should be in its own file called MovieTestDrive.java, same with EchoTestDrive.


**Part C**


Is this still an issue? Let's work on it after class today if you have time, or come to office hours this week on Thurday.
