Submit your answers below to this [Canvas assignment for screenshots](https://canvas.evergreen.edu/courses/7771/assignments/145079) and this [Canvas assignment for written answers](https://canvas.evergreen.edu/courses/7771/assignments/145080).

## Part 1: SimpleStartup Game Strategy

Review the [last change we made to the `SimpleStartup` game Java files in `activities/week-08`](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/dgp-25au/commit/cc3fee2e35742674d89ac209ffb38b6c08ab157b)
as well as [the class recordings from Monday, December 1st](https://evergreen.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=ca7e9919-4912-47fa-b8e6-b3a7004a3c11).

Complete the winning strategy we started following this pseudocode,
or your own idea at the same level of detail sufficient to write code.

* Loop i from 0 to 6
*   guess(i)
*   if result of the guess is a hit
*      break (save the value of i)
* Loop j from i increasing
*   until guess(j) is no longer a hit
* Loop j from i decreasing
*   until guess(j) is no longer a hit

Modify your code to print out the guess of your strategy.

Submit a screenshot of your Java program running on a terminal to completion.

## Part 2: Reading

Read Chapter 6 of Head First Java, if you have not already done so for [Homework 08](https://github.com/TheEvergreenStateCollege/dgp-25au/blob/main/homeworks/HW-08.md).

### 2a)

Do the exercise on page 146 and 147, by typing the English explanation next to each of the numbers 1 through 21.

### 2b)
Answer the following questions:
* What are three methods of the `ArrayList` class and what do they do? What parameters do they take (give both the meaning and the type)
* What are three ways of knowing which classes are available in the Java standard library (part of the Java API)?

### 2c)
Come up with one question as you read that will help you or your classmates better understand the material.
