## Devin Eason

1. Name three computer science topics and projects you've enjoyed learning and working on at Evergreen.
  - DSA has always been fun to learn about. I like learning about new data structures with interesting applications.
  - I liked making a website with 1990s style visuals in Student Originated Software.
  - Making the framework of a text adventure style game was also a lot of fun.

2. What about a game (video, PC, board, card, or otherwise) makes it fun for you?
  - I like exploration in video games. Among others, the feeling of going through a nook or cranny and discovering an expansive hidden area is particularly satisfying.
3. Can you give an example from an actual game you enjoy playing?
   a. In another browser window, look up some game art or gameplay screenshots and copy them to your clipboard

3. How would you describe a strategy for playing the game above in one sentence? (Does not need to be winning)
   - Stay calm, be patient, and try, try again.
4. What would you like to do with the ideas, skills, and knowledge you'll learn this quarter?
   - I'd like to learn good ways to code intelligent enemy AI. I'm working on a game project and I think this will be good practice for designing enemy intelligence in that game.
