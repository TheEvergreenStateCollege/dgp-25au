1. I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about low-level programming, CPU architecture, and cybernetic devices in biology-inspired computing.
   Cybernetics is my main focus, so I obviously enjoyed the brief cybernetics seminar component of Computer Science Foundations.
2. "What makes a game fun?" is something I've been thinking a lot about. I have a lot of nebulous ideas around something I'm calling the
   'ludic impulse', the idea that humans are predisposed to learn through play, but nothing really concrete (it's an idea I originally
   developed for sport, but can easily be applied to games broadly). For me personally, it's the 'action-reaction-action' system, the
   'doing-a-thing, seeing-what-happens, learning-from-it' system.
3. In Chants of Sennaar, you play as a humanoid translator. It's the Tower of Babel story, but as a video game. It's your job as the character
   to interpret the glyphs that other people speak as words, and reconnect the different inhabitants. There's a ton of trial-and-error,
   but that's the idea. You are absolutely not supposed to try and brute-force the solution. It requires patience, which is aided by it being
   very relaxing atmospherically.
   c. Paste this screenshot below this question, paste it like this

5. As I alluded to above, patience and a willingness to *really* think outside the box with regards to what's going on. Things are not
   always as they seem.
