# Class Introductions

Purpose of this activity:
* Practice Markdown for documentation that we'll be using in this class and on GitHub
* Prime your brain to think about dividing up strategies so that multiple people can work on them
* Learn and share with other class members about the sub-strategy you'd like to work on

## Step 1.
Copy the following lines in the gray box (our template).

```
## <Your Name>

1. Name a two- or multi-player game that you enjoy playing (can be the same or different from Week 1 activity)
2. What about playing a multi-player game is fun for you? Use examples from the game you chose in number 1.
3. What is a strategy for winning this game that you can describe in two parts, one for each player?
4. What coordination do the two players need, in order to implement the strategy above? some examples:
   * moving together, staying close by 
   * dividing up work in different areas of the map
5. Search the internet for an image that suggests or depicts in some way the division of strategy that you chose above.
```

## Step 2.
Click the "Add file" button to add a new page to this directory named after yourself.

For example, if your name is "ABC" you would create a new file in this directory
called `ABC.md` and paste the lines below into it. Then 
update it and personalize it to tell us more about yourself.

## Step 3.
Paste the lines from the template into the big textinput for the file content.

## Step 4.
You can switch back and forth between the `Preview` and `Edit` tabs to see how your markdown is rendered.

## Step 5.
When you're finished, you can click "Commit changes" and accept the default message to add your file to the class repository.
(We'll learn more about Git, repositories, and line changes in the coming weeks).
