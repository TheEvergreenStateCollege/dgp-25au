    A. With a team, proposing and designing a data collection system for Evergreen's organic farm
    B. A Discord bot for letting you query about the weather in a particular U.S. city
    C. A visualization for labelling cities on a map of the U.S.

2. Pixellated art, differences between night and day, monsters to defend against
3. Kingdom, a sidescrolling tower defense game on steam. (Minecraft has these features too)

4. I don't remember exactly, but growing your defenses slowly and not expanding too quickly to stretch your resources thin.
5. I'd like to make a fun visualization for learning and teaching pathfinding algorithms.
6. An event in the game is that if the monster overrun your defenses and make it to you, the king, sitting on your steed, they can knock you off. If you are already on foot, they will knock the crown off your head, the camera goes into slow motion and there is a chilling metal clanking sound played as the crown tumbles away. The human value is one of losing agency, your status as ruler and protector of your kingdom, and also a valuable object which is your gold jeweled crown. For me, this creates an emotion of dread or sadness, as well as desire to try again.
