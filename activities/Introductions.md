You are free to add more lines and use other features of [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet),
the simplified markup language we are using in this file and any other file ending in `.md`.

Markdown is the official documentation format on GitHub and many other platforms, and is
a valuable Markup for you to learn and practice.

As an example, look at this page introducing [your instructor](Paul.md).
