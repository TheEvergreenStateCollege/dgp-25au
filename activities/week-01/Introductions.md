# Class Introductions

Purpose of this activity:
* Learn Markdown for documentation that we'll be using in this class and on GitHub
* Prime your brain to think about games, fun, victory conditions, rules, and winning strategies
* Learn and share with other class members about yourself and your goals

## Step 1.
Copy the following lines in the gray box (our template).

```
## <Your Name>

1. Name three computer science topics and projects you've enjoyed learning and working on at Evergreen.
2. What about a game (video, PC, board, card, or otherwise) makes it fun for you?
3. Can you give an example from an actual game you enjoy playing?
   a. In another browser window, look up some game art or gameplay screenshots and copy them to your clipboard
   b. or take a screenshot from a game you are currently playing, if any.
   c. Paste this screenshot below this question, paste it like this

3. How would you describe a strategy for playing the game above in one sentence? (Does not need to be winning)
4. What would you like to do with the ideas, skills, and knowledge you'll learn this quarter?
   a. In other words, what are your goals for taking this class?

## Step 2.
Click the "Add file" button to add a new page to this directory named after yourself.

For example, if your name is "ABC" you would create a new file in this directory
called `ABC.md` and paste the lines below into it. Then 
update it and personalize it to tell us more about yourself.

## Step 3.
Paste the lines from the template into the big textinput for the file content.

## Step 4.
You can switch back and forth between the `Preview` and `Edit` tabs to see how your markdown is rendered.

## Step 5.
When you're finished, you can click "Commit changes" and accept the default message to add your file to the class repository.
(We'll learn more about Git, repositories, and line changes in the coming weeks).

## Step 6.

Update your markdown file with an additional item, using your chosen game.

Try to describe an *event*, its change in *human values*, and what *emotion* it brings up in you
as you play your chosen game.

## Other comments
Don't worry, you can go back and make more changes or fix mistakes in the future, and these will be recorded as
new line changes, in a new "commit".

You are free to add more lines and use other features of [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/markdown-cheatsheet),
the simplified markup language we are using in this file and any other file ending in `.md`.

Markdown is the official documentation format on GitHub and many other platforms, and is
a valuable Markup for you to learn and practice.

As an example, look at this page introducing [your instructor](Paul.md).
