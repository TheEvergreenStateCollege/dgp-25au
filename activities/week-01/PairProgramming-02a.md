# Pair Programming Activity (Week 2a)
## Monday, 

Pair programming is a mode of programming where two learners work at one computer
(or on one screenshare if learning online) and take turns
playing one of two roles.

* Driver, the person who is typing code.
* Navigator, the person who is
  * reading reference materials, including this tutorial
  * searching for answers on the internet

Optionally, a third person can be a

* Facilitator, monitoring
  * how the driver and navigator are interacting, the emotional tone
  * the energy of the pair and whether anyone is tired
  * switching the role of driver and navigator

In class sessions, Paul the instructor will act as a facilitator.

Outside of class, both the driver and navigator will need to act
as facilitator for each other.
