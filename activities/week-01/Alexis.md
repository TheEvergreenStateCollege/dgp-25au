I have thoroughly enjoyed learning about low-level programming, CPU architecture, and cybernetic devices in biology-inspired computing. Cybernetics is my main focus, so I obviously enjoyed the brief cybernetics seminar component of Computer Science Foundations.

"What makes a game fun?" is something I've been thinking a lot about. I have a lot of nebulous ideas around something I'm calling the 'ludic impulse', the idea that humans are predisposed to learn through play, but nothing really concrete (it's an idea I originally developed for sport, but can easily be applied to games broadly). For me personally, it's the 'action-reaction-action' system, the 'doing-a-thing, seeing-what-happens, learning-from-it' system.

In Chants of Sennaar, you play as a humanoid translator. It's the Tower of Babel story, but as a video game. It's your job as the character to interpret the glyphs that other people speak as words, and reconnect the different inhabitants. There's a ton of trial-and-error, but that's the idea. You are absolutely not supposed to try and brute-force the solution. It requires patience, which is aided by it being very relaxing atmospherically.

As I alluded to above, patience and a willingness to *really* think outside the box with regards to what's going on. Things are not always as they seem.

A very human value introduced in this game is alterations to knowing/not-knowing. As humans, we are not inclined to confusion and/or not-knowing as a preferred state of mind, and very frequently the game can alter these two values seemingly at will. There are also other ones, but they are story related and I absolutely do not want to spoil.

For this undergraduate research opportunity, I really want to dial in on the skills that will benefit me doing research work in graduate school and future employment. I don't mean this in exclusively technical terms, although proficiency in UNIX systems and Git are always useful as well as expanding my limited capabilities in Java, but also in collaborative group work and independent thinking.
