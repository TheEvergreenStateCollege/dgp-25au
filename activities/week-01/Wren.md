## Wren

1. I did a project examining the biases programmed into Generative AI that I found very interesting. I also did a project where I created an SQL database that was interesting. I'm also in the process of making a recipe app that.
2. I like games that have a high degree of immersion. I like to feel like I can get lost in the world of the game and forget real life for a bit.
3. I enjoy Rimworld a lot.

3. Research fabrication as soon as possible, grow high value crops for trading, train all pawns for combat.
4. I don't have any specific goals in mind other than trying to increase my chances of finding a job after graduation.
