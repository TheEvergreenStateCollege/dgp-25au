# Distributed Gameplaying in Java I

Welcome to the class monorepo for the class DGP in Fall Quarter, 2025.

We are a fork of the Battlecode 2025 competition. We are learning game design
how to formulate strategies, and how to find and repair bugs.

We'll use this repo to participate in class activities and develop player
code in Java to implement and demonstrate our strategies in an attempt to
defeat the reference player.

The players will be named after the class session where they are developed,
and are located in the directories below matching their Java package names.

The main class in each case is called `RobotPlayer.java`
